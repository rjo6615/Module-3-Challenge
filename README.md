# Module-3-Challenge

## Description

While learning web development it is important to put together a portfolio so
I put together this project to display my work and information to possible employers.
This project allowed me to display my skills in building a web page while providing useful
information to click through about my work and myself. It was also a good learning process
where I could utalize the skills ive learned thus far to put together a functional website.
